# disco-servo

Beware all ye who enter here! This mod is very early alpha. It activates and sends commands to the CHUCK servo rails. We still don't know if using this mod may interfere with other servo functions such as flight controls. Please use with care.

Parrot Disco servo software mod to allow the additional PWM servo ports on the CHUCK to be controlled by Skycontroller 2

Since this mode uses TELNET as an interface for sending commands from the skycontroler to the disco, each time you start the disco and wish to use the servomod, you will have to quickly double press the start button in order the disco to start its TELNET server, else, the skycontroler will not be able to send servo commands.
